# Splitwise Bill Splitter

This is an hobby project to split the grocery expense among my roommates to easily calculate the split with tax percentages and present it in neat tabular visualization.

This expense is then published to splitwise group if `--publish` flag is added to the command.

This program accepts the input in the form of Excel which is created from prebuilt excel template.
